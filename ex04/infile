The old old old man walked past the old old old tree,
which had old leaves rustling in the old breeze.
His old shoes tapped on the old old road as the old dog barked
at an old old old cat sitting on an old bench. Nearby, an old old sign swayed,
covered in old dust,
pointing to the old old old shop that sold nothing but old old old things.
The old man chuckled to himself,
wondering if the old clock in the old window was as old as the old town itself,
and he continued on his old path, thinking about how old everything really was.
